<p>Certain items are considered hazardous and, by federal law, are prohibited from all National Airlines flights. Check here, before you try to check it or carry it on. Keep in mind, this is not a comprehensive list. Visit the FAA’s Pack Safe web site for the most current list of what can and cannot be transported on passenger aircraft or as a Supernumeraries/Couriers on Cargo Flights. </p>
<p><strong><u>Alcohol or Liquor </u></strong><br />
Alcohol or liquor purchased after going through the security checkpoint are allowed onboard as checked or carry-on baggage, as long as it adheres to these guidelines: </p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol content may not exceed 140 proof. </li>
<li>Up to 5 liters of alcohol per person between 48 and 140 proof is permitted.  </li>
<li>Alcohol under 48 proof is not considered hazardous and is permitted.  </li>
<li>Alcohol must be in its original unopened retail packaging to be permitted onboard the plane.  </li>
<li>If the alcohol is purchased before going through the security checkpoint, our security rules apply for carry-on or checked baggage.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Automotive </u></strong><br />
In general, auto and vehicle parts are allowed in carry-on or checked baggage only if they&#8217;ve been properly purged and if there is no fuel or traces of fuel present. Car engine parts may be placed in checked luggage only if the parts are packed in their original box and free of hazardous chemicals such as gasoline and oil. </p>
<ul>
<li>Here&#8217;s more information on specific car parts: </li>
<li>Shock absorbers that are sealed with compressed gas will not be allowed in checked baggage. Even if a shock absorber is not sealed with compressed gas, if it contains residue or vapors of oil or gasoline, it is considered a hazardous material and will be removed from checked baggage. </li>
<li>Car batteries are prohibited in both carry-on and checked baggage, per FAA regulations. </li>
<li>Vehicle airbags are prohibited in both carry-on and checked baggage, per FAA regulations. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the vehicle parts you are planning to pack are used or you are not sure you can remove all hazmat residue or vapors, we recommend that you ship them to your destination using a parcel shipping service instead. </p>
<p><strong><u>Avalanche Rescue Pack, Self-Inflating </u></strong><br />
These devices typically contain a cylinder of compressed nonflammable gas. Some models also contain a small explosive charge (squib) to release the cylinder contents. </p>
<p>Though allowed in checked baggage by international (ICAO/IATA) regulations, these devices are not allowed in baggage in the U.S. unless the gas cylinder is empty and there is no explosive charge.</p>
<p><strong><u>Battery Powered Self-Balancing Personal Transportation Device (Hoverboards) </u></strong><br />
To ensure the safety of our customers and employees, Delta will not accept the transport of balance gilders, hoverboards, powered skateboards, motorized riding suitcases and self-balancing boards of any type which use lithium or lithium-ion batteries on board its aircraft. These items are prohibited as both carry-on and checked baggage. </p>
<p>Delta reviewed the hoverboard product specifications and found that manufactures do not consistently provide details about the size or power of their lithium-ion batteries. These devices often contain battery varieties above the government mandated 160-watt hour limit permitted aboard aircraft. While occurrences are uncommon, these batteries can spontaneously overheat and pose a fire hazard risk.</p>
<p><strong><u>Dry Ice </u></strong><br />
Dry-ice packages in amounts of 5.5 lbs. (2.5 kg) or less is allowed when used to cool non-hazardous perishables in carry-on or checked baggage. The package must: </p>
<ul>
<li>Meet carry-on baggage restrictions. </li>
<li>Allow the release of carbon dioxide. </li>
<li>State on the package, &#8220;Dry Ice&#8221; or &#8220;Carbon Dioxide Solid&#8221; </li>
<li>Specify the net weight of the dry-ice material on the packaging. </li>
<li>Include the contents being cooled, in writing, on the packaging. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>E-cigarettes </u></strong><br />
Battery-powered portable electronic smoking devices (e.g., e-cigarettes, e-cigs, e-cigars, e-pipes, e-hookahs, personal vaporizers, electronic nicotine delivery systems) when carried by passengers or crewmembers for personal use must be carried on one&#8217;s person or in carry-on baggage only. Recharging of the devices and/or the batteries on board the aircraft is not permitted. We recommend traveling with them in a designated carry case to prevent damage and/or unintentional activation. </p>
<p><strong><u>Fireworks or Explosives </u></strong><br />
Don&#8217;t even think about it. Firecrackers, signal flares, Christmas crackers or sparklers are not allowed — as carry-on or checked baggage — at any time. </p>
<p><strong><u>Flammable Liquids or Solids </u></strong><br />
Guidelines for carrying flammable liquids are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>A fuel lighter is permitted in your pocket or in carry-on baggage only. </li>
<li>Up to two lighters are allowed in your checked baggage if they are properly enclosed in a U.S. Department of Transportation approved case. </li>
<li>Lighters without fuel are allowed as checked or carry-on baggage. </li>
<li>Lighter refills, fuels (such as gasoline or Sterno cans), paints, stains, lubricants, and &#8220;strike-anywhere&#8221; matches are not allowed. </li>
<li>One regular matchbook is permitted in your pocket as long as it isn’t the &#8220;strike anywhere&#8221; matches. </li>
<li>Torch or blue flame lighters are strictly prohibited. </li>
<li>Lithium battery powered lighters without a safety cap or means of protection against unintentional activation are prohibited in carry-on baggage, checked baggage, and as when carried on one’s person. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Fuel Cell Systems </u></strong><br />
Guidelines for fuel cell systems are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Portable electronic devices (i.e. cameras, cellular phones, laptop computers and camcorders) powered by fuel cell systems, and not more than two spare fuel cell cartridges per passenger are allowed when transported in carry-on baggage. </li>
<li>No more than two spare fuel cell cartridges may be carried by a passenger. </li>
<li>Fuel cell systems containing fuel and fuel cell cartridges, including spare cartridges, are permitted in carry-on baggage only. </li>
<li>Fuel cell cartridges may not be refillable by the user. Refueling the fuel cell systems is not permitted, except that the installation of a spare cartridge is allowed. </li>
<li>Each fuel cell cartridge and system must be durably marked by the manufacturer with the wording: &#8220;APPROVED FOR CARRIAGE IN AIRCRAFT CABIN ONLY&#8221;. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Gasoline-powered Devices </u></strong><br />
Gasoline-powered equipment, such as chainsaws and lawn equipment, is only allowed if it&#8217;s new and in its original packaging and has never been opened. </p>
<p><strong><u>Household Items (Aerosols, bleach, etc.) </u></strong><br />
Aerosols (i.e. spray disinfectant and starch), bleach, cleaning solvents, drain cleaners and pesticides are not allowed. </p>
<p><strong><u>Liquid Nitrogen (Dry shipper) </u></strong><br />
Insulated packaging containing refrigerated liquid nitrogen is allowed as checked and carry-on baggage if it is fully porous material, intended for transport of non-dangerous products and kept at a low temperature. </p>
<p><strong><u>Lithium Batteries </u></strong><br />
As you probably know, traveling with consumer electronic and medical devices containing lithium cells or batteries (e.g. watches, calculators, cameras, cell phones, laptops, camcorders, hearing aids, etc.) is allowed onboard as carry-on. Spare lithium batteries are allowed as carry-on only and must be individually protected to prevent short circuits.</p>
<p>Tips to properly transport spare lithium batteries: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pack spare batteries in carry-on baggage.
<li>Keep spare batteries in the original retail packaging to prevent unintentional activation or short-circuiting. </li>
<li>If original packaging is not available, effectively insulate battery terminals by isolating spare batteries from contact with other batteries and/or metal. </li>
<li>Specifically, place each battery in its own protective case, plastic bag or package, or place tape across the battery&#8217;s contacts to isolate terminals. </li>
<p>Take steps to prevent crushing, puncturing, or putting a high degree of pressure on the battery, as this can cause an internal short circuit, resulting in overheating.
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Size Limits for Lithium Batteries: </u></strong><br />
Passengers are permitted to travel with lithium-ion batteries that contain a maximum of 160-watt hours per battery. Any lithium-ion battery containing more than 160-watt hours is prohibited from carriage on all passenger aircraft. Lithium-ion batteries installed in a personal electronic device can be transported as checked or carry-on baggage. Lithium-ion batteries not installed in a device (spares) must be in carry-on baggage and no more than two (2) spares between 100- and 160-watt hours are allowed. </p>
<p><strong><u>Quantity Limits for Lithium Batteries: </u></strong><br />
Each person is limited to a maximum of 20 spare batteries. </p>
<p>For more information on dangerous goods, visit the FAA&#8217;s “Pack Safe” web site. Damaged, defective, or recalled lithium batteries must not be carried in carry-on or checked baggage. Additional information concerning recalled consumer batteries and battery systems may be located on the Consumer Product Safety Commission website. </p>
<p><strong><u>Personal Care Items </u></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Personal oxygen canisters also known as “canned oxygen,” “recreational oxygen” and “flavored oxygen” are forbidden in aircraft cabins, carry-on baggage, and checked baggage.
<li>Personal care items, such as cologne and hairspray, are allowed in checked baggage without prior approval, if there are less than 16 ounces of each item and less than 70 ounces total. Personal care items in smaller quantities, which comply with TSA rules may also be placed in carry-on baggage. </li>
<li>One butane curling iron per passenger is permitted in carry-on baggage. No refills are allowed, and the safety cover must be on the curling iron. It is not permissible to be used on the aircraft at any time. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Personal Flotation Devices </u></strong><br />
Though we provide life jackets for each and every passenger, you are welcome to bring your own. One self-inflating life jacket, containing no more than two small carbon dioxide cylinders plus no more than two spare cylinders, is allowed as checked or carry-on baggage. </p>
<p><strong><u>Personal Medical Devices </u></strong><br />
Personal medical devices must meet specific requirements and be approved by National Airlines prior to travel. Liquid oxygen is not permitted.</p>
<p><strong><u>Portable Electronic Devices </u></strong><br />
Devices containing lithium metal or lithium-ion batteries (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) should be transported in carry-on baggage and not placed in checked baggage.<br />
When that is not possible: the devices should be completely powered down to the OFF position (they should not be left in sleep mode), protected from accidental activation, and packed so they are protected from damage.<br />
Each person is limited to a maximum of 15 PEDs.<br />
Damaged, defective, or recalled lithium batteries must not be carried in carry-on or checked baggage. Additional information concerning recalled batteries and battery systems may be located on the Consumer Product Safety Commission website. </p>
<p><strong><u>Smart Baggage </u></strong><br />
Recent developments of innovative baggage with integrated lithium batteries, commonly known as &#8220;smart baggage&#8221; are being marketed and sold to the traveling public. These devices include integrated lithium batteries, motors, power banks, GPS, GSM, Bluetooth, RFID or Wi-Fi technology. The presence of lithium batteries can contravene various regulatory requirements. These devices require careful attention &#8211; even if permitted by the applicable regulations. </p>
<p>Examples of &#8220;smart&#8221; baggage include features such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium-ion battery and motor allowing it to be used as a personal transportation device, either as a stand-up scooter, or sit on vehicle. These devices do not meet the criteria of a mobility device.
<li>Lithium-ion battery power bank that allows charging of other electronic devices such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops. </li>
<li>GPS tracking devices with or without GSM capability </li>
<li>Bluetooth, RFID and Wi-Fi capability </li>
<li>Electronic baggage tags </li>
<li>Electronic Lock/s </li>
<li>Lithium-ion battery, motor and tracking device (GPS) allowing the bag to self-propel and &#8216;follow&#8217; the owner. </li>
</ul>
<p>Restrictions that apply to the carriage of this smart baggage. Specifically, that: </p>
<ul>
<li>The lithium-ion batteries must have a power rating of not more than 100Wh unless the customer has approval from the operator, in which case the lithium battery must not have a Watt-hour rating exceeding 160Wh
<li>Customers checking a smart bag with a removable lithium-ion battery must remove it and take it with them into the cabin. Customers carrying-on a smart bag containing a removable lithium-ion battery must remove it from the designed enclosure prior to boarding the aircraft. Once the battery is removed from the bag’s </li>
<li>designed enclosure, the battery may be placed inside the carry-on bag. The removable battery does not need to be carried separately from the smart baggage. </li>
<li>Where a bag intended to be carried in the cabin is surrendered at the boarding gate or on the aircraft to be loaded in the cargo compartment, the customer must remove lithium-ion batteries from the bag before it can be loaded into the cargo compartment. The spare battery/power bank must then be carried in the cabin. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Sports Equipment </u></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Camping equipment containing fuel or fuel residue, including butane or propane canisters, is not allowed.</li>
<li>Self-inflating devices or equipment containing compressed gas cylinders are allowed as long as the cylinders are less than 50 milliliters (mL). A total of four (4) cylinders may be carried if installed inside the device or as spares. (e.g., rafts or paintball cartridges). For self-inflating life jackets, see Personal Flotation Devices. </li>
<li>You may bring compressed gas cylinders, including scuba tanks, as carry-on or checked baggage, as long as the regulator valve is completely disconnected from the cylinder. </li>
<li>Parachutes &#8211; you may bring skydiving rigs with and without Automatic Activation Devices (AAD) as carry-on or checked baggage. Typically, a rig will move through the checked luggage or carry-on security screening process without needing physical inspection. If security officers determine that they need to open a rig to inspect it, you must be present and will be allowed to assist. For this reason, skydivers should add at least 30 minutes to the airline&#8217;s recommended arrival window when they are traveling with their parachutes. </li>
<li>When checking the parachute in as checked baggage, pack the rig separately without any other items in the bag. Additional items, if suspicious, could trigger an inspection of the entire bag. Parachute owners may help security officers unpack and repack the rig. </li>
</ul>

<p>3. The Shipper shall have the duty to prepare and present a current version of the Forwarder’s airbill for each shipment. If a person other than the Shipper prepares the airbill, that person shall be deemed to have done so as agent for the Shipper. If other shipping documentation, including without limitation a prior version of the Forwarder’s airbill or customer-provided documentation, is received by Forwarder and used for the purpose of carriage, it shall be used for convenience purposes only; any terms and conditions on such documentation will not change or supersede these Terms; and the Shipments concerned shall be subject to these Terms and the terms on the reverse of the airbill in effect at the time of shipping. The airbill shall be non-negotiable and shall be binding on the Shipper. The Shipper hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless Forwarder against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, expenses (including attorney’s fees and expenses), demands, and suits arising out of or attributable to the use of shipping documentation other than the airbill and for any inaccuracy or incompleteness in the particulars entered on the airbill or such other shipping documentation.</p>
<p>4.

<p>5. It is the shipper’s sole responsibility to accurately and completely:</p>
<p>5a. specify the contents of all Shipments on the airbill;</p>
<p>5b. provide a legible Shipper contact name and telephone number on the airbill;</p>
<p>5c. provide a legible consignee contact name, telephone number, address, and ZIP/postal code on the airbill;</p>

<p>5f. accurately and completely package, mark and label lithium battery shipments in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and Forwarder requirements applicable to shipments of lithium batteries.</p>
<p>6. Shipper warrants and represents to Forwarder that</p>
<p>6a. all statements and information contained in airbill and any other shipping document are true, complete and accurate</p>
<p>6b. with respect to each package in this Shipment, that the contents are fully and accurately described on the airbill and other shipping document by the proper shipping name, and are classified, packaged, marked, and labeled/placarded, and are in all respects in proper condition for transport according to applicable international and national governmental regulations.</p>
<p>6c. all pieces presented for carriage comply with the restrictions set forth in these Terms;</p>
<p>6d. except as prepared for carriage by Forwarder, have been prepared in secure premises by the Shipper (in the case of an individual Shipper), or by reliable staff employed by the Shipper;</p>
<p>6e. have been protected against unauthorized interference at all stages during their preparation, storage, and transportation before their presentation to Forwarder for carriage; and</p>
<p>6f. for articles shipped in unenclosed containers, Forwarder shall not be liable for damage/loss unless mishandling and/or loss is evident and is so noted on the delivery receipt at time of delivery.</p>
<p>7. Forwarder relies on the foregoing declaration, representation and warranty in accepting any piece for carriage hereunder.</p>
<p>8. Forwarder’s liability, liability for all damages shall be limited to the higher of $50.00 per Shipment or $0.50 per pound ($1.10 per kilogram) of that part of the cargo adversely affected thereby, unless at the time of Shipment the Shipper makes a declaration of value for carriage in the space designated on the airbill and pays the appropriate valuation charge, in which event Forwarder’s liability shall not exceed such higher declared value. Shipper assumes all risk of any loss, damage, or delay in excess of the declared value or liability limitations set forth herein. If Shipper sends more than one piece on an airbill, Shipper shall specify the declared value for each piece; otherwise, the declared value for each piece shall be determined by dividing the total declared value by the number of pieces on the airbill. The maximum declared value per Shipment is one hundred thousand U.S. dollars (US$100,000), and any effort to declare a value in excess of this maximum shall be null and void. Regardless of the value declared, the number of Shipments transported by Forwarder, or the number of distinct shippers affected by a disaster, accident, or other event.</p>
<p>9. The following articles shall not be accepted for carriage: any Shipment prohibited by law; household goods and/or personal effects; original works of art, antiques, bonds, coins of any kind, currency, currency equivalents, furs, fur clothing, gems or stones (cut or uncut), industrial diamonds, gold or silver, coined concentrates, jewelry (other than costume jewelry), pearls, precious metals, securities (negotiable), time sensitive written material (for example, bids, contract proposals, etc.), when the declared value exceeds fifty U.S. cents (US$0.50) per pound; or one-of-a-kind articles or models, prototypes, valuable rugs (that is, Oriental rugs, Persian rugs) and prints or lithographs when the total declared value of the Shipment exceeds five hundred U.S. dollars (US$500.00) or when the declared value exceeds fifty U.S. cents (US$0.50) per pound, per piece. Forwarder shall not be liable for any loss, damage, delay, liabilities or penalties resulting from the transportation of any of the foregoing articles, however described or misdescribed in this airbill, and no employee or agent of Forwarder has any authority to accept for transportation such articles or to waive the limitations herein contained.</p>
<p>10. Shipper shall limit all packages containing hazardous materials/dangerous goods to the materials and quantities authorized for air transportation under the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;USDOT”) hazardous materials transportation regulations (49 C.F.R. Parts 171, 172, and 173) and the current edition of the International Air Transport Association (&#8220;IATA”) Dangerous Goods Regulations (together &#8220;HM/DG Regulations&#8221;). Shipper shall ensure that each Shipment requiring a Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods under the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations is accompanied by properly executed Declaration documents in conformity with the requirements of such IATA Regulations. Shipper shall also ensure, and Shipper hereby certifies, that, before tendering any Shipment containing hazardous materials/dangerous goods to Forwarder, the contents of this consignment are fully and accurately described on the shipping papers by proper shipping name; are not prohibited for transport by air by the HM/DG Regulations; and are properly classified, packaged, marked, and labeled, and in proper condition for carriage by air as required by the HM/DG Regulations. Shipper hereby declares that all of the applicable air transport requirements have been met. This Paragraph shall apply regardless of the routing or transportation mode by which the Shipment is transported. Forwarder reserves the right to reject any Shipment containing any known or suspected dangerous goods.</p>
<p>11. If the Shipper does not complete all the documents required for the service, or if the documents submitted are not appropriate for the service or destination requested, Forwarder may in its discretion, and where permitted by law, complete, correct, or replace the documents for the Shipper at the Shipper’s expense, and at Shipper’s risk, but is not obligated to do so. The terms of the airbill shall apply regardless of Forwarder’s completion of a substitute form of air waybill to complete the receipt or delivery of the shipment. Forwarder shall not be liable to the shipper or any other person for its actions under this provision.</p>
<p>12. Any Shipment is subject to inspection, however, Forwarder is not obligated to perform such inspection, except as may be required by law. Forwarder reserves the right to reject any Shipment for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to, safety or security concerns.</p>
<p>13. Shipper acknowledges that Forwarder, like all indirect air carriers, is required by the Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“TSA”) to maintain an air cargo security program. <b>If Shipper is acting as an agent, authorized representative, broker, carrier, or other freight intermediary for any other person or entity,</b> Shipper shall disclose that fact to Forwarder and shall assist Forwarder in complying with the TSA requirements by enabling Forwarder to obtain any necessary documents from, or otherwise qualify, such other person or entity. <b>As required by TSA regulations (49 C.F.R. § 1548.9(b)), Shipper hereby consents to a search or inspection of the cargo, including screening of the cargo.</b> If Shipper, as the person who originates and tenders cargo for air transportation or as such person’s representative, is an individual (natural person), such person shall advise Forwarder of that fact, and Forwarder shall, if required by law, provide Shipper or such person with a Privacy Act Notice.</p>
<p>14. Rates and charges for this Shipment shall be based on actual or dimensional weight, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>15. Forwarder’s care, custody, and control over the Shipment shall commence when the Shipment is safely received by Forwarder or its authorized agent, and shall terminate when delivered to the consignee, owner or any other party entitled to receive the Shipment or to such other destination as Shipper may designate.</p>
<p>16. FORWARDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, INTEREST, UTILITY, OR LOSS OF MARKET, WHETHER OR NOT FORWARDER KNEW OR HAD REASON TO KNOW THAT SUCH DAMAGES MIGHT BE INCURRED. Due to the nature of the transportation business, Forwarder does not guarantee pick up, transportation, or delivery by a stipulated date or a stipulated time, nor shall Forwarder be liable for the consequences of failure to do so.</p>
<p>17. The following provisions shall apply to all claims for loss, damage, or delay. Forwarder shall be given notice of any claim for loss or damage in writing within ten (10) calendar days after the delivery the Shipment or, of any claim for delay, within seventeen (17) calendar days of the date of tender to the consignee. The notice of claim shall include complete consignor and consignee information, the airbill reference number, the date of the Shipment, the number of pieces, and the Shipment weight. Failure to provide Forwarder with notice in the manner and within the time limits set forth herein shall result in the claim being denied. Forwarder is not obligated to act on any claim until all transportation charges have been paid. The claim amount may not be deducted from these charges or from any outstanding balance owed to Forwarder without the prior written approval of Forwarder. All of the original shipping containers, packing, packages, and contents shall be available for Forwarder’s inspection and retained until the claim is resolved. Except as otherwise provided for herein, receipt of the Shipment by the consignee without written notice of damage on the airbill or delivery receipt shall be considered to be prima facie evidence that the Shipment was delivered in good condition. For claims involving concealed damage not discovered at the time of delivery, Shipper or consignee shall notify Forwarder as promptly as possible after the discovery of the damage, and in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days after the date of delivery. Under no circumstances shall Forwarder be liable for loss, damage, or delay to the external shipping containers used in the transportation of the Shipment. Any lawsuit to enforce a claim shall be brought against Forwarder within two (2) years from the date of delivery of the Shipment or from the date on which the Shipment should have been delivered. The failure of Shipper to comply with the notice provisions specified herein shall be an absolute bar to any such lawsuit filed against Forwarder.</p>
<p>18. In the event of the failure or inability of the consignee to take delivery of the Shipment, Forwarder shall notify Shipper in writing at the address shown on the shipping document and request disposition instructions. If Shipper fails to provide disposition instructions within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of Forwarder’s notice, Forwarder shall return the Shipment to Shipper at Shipper’s expense. If Shipper fails to accept delivery of a Shipment thus returned, Forwarder may, upon thirty (30) calendar days written notice to Shipper, dispose of the Shipment at public or private sale and pay itself out of the proceeds to satisfy the transportation and storage charges owing on the Shipment. Any sums collected by Forwarder in excess of such transportation charges shall be paid to Shipper. No sale or disposal pursuant to this rule shall discharge any liability or lien to any greater extent than the proceeds thereof. The Shipper and the consignee shall remain liable, jointly and severally, for any deficiency.</p>
<p>19. Forwarder shall not be liable for loss, damage, delay or monetary loss of any type caused by: Acts of God; public authorities acting with actual or apparent authority; strikes; labor disputes; weather; mechanical failures; aircraft failures; civil commotions; acts or omissions of customs or quarantine officials; the nature and inherent vice of the freight or any defects thereof; public enemies; hazards incident to a state of war; acts of terrorism; and by acts, defaults or omissions of Shipper or consignee for failure to observe the terms and conditions of the contract of carriage contained in this shipping document, including but not limited to improper packaging, classifying, marking, labeling, incomplete/inaccurate shipping instructions, and failure to observe the rules relating to freight not acceptable for transportation or to freight acceptable only under certain conditions outlined below.</p>
<p>20. If this is an international Shipment, all of the following terms shall govern: (a) all rules relating to liability as established by the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention, whichever is deemed applicable, shall apply; (b) except as otherwise provided in Forwarder’s tariffs or conditions of carriage and as to carriage to which the Warsaw Convention or Montreal Convention does not apply, Forwarder’s liability shall not exceed twenty U.S. dollars (US$20.00) per kilogram or the equivalent of goods lost, damaged, or delayed, unless a higher value is declared by Shipper and a supplementary charge paid; (c) Forwarder accepts this shipping document as Shipper’s letter of instructions with authorization to prepare and sign on Shipper’s behalf an international shipping document; (d) Forwarder reserves the option to act as agent of the carrier, instead of as a forwarder, in which event the direct carrier’s tariffs shall apply to this Shipment; and (e) Shipper may select by inserting on the face of this shipping document cargo coverage based on insurance and/or declared value for carriage.</p>
<p>21. Collect on Delivery (C.O.D.) service is provided under the following conditions: (a) Shipper shall identify the Shipment as a C.O.D. shipment by entering the amount to be collected in the “Shipper’s C.O.D. Box” on the front of this shipping document, (b) Shipper shall specify the type of payment to be received (for example, cash, check, money order, or cashier’s check) in the “Special Services Box” on the front of this shipping document and (c) Forwarder and Shipper agree that Forwarder does not guarantee nor verify that a check, money order, cashier’s check, or other such financial instrument is valid or negotiable. All payments are collected at Shipper’s risk. Unless inserted otherwise on the face of this shipping document, the C.O.D. amount of the Shipment shall be deemed to be the declared value for carriage amount. This declared value for carriage amount in excess of fifty U.S. cents (US$0.50) per pound, per piece, shall be subject to an excess valuation charge. Unless prior arrangements are made, the acceptance of cash by Forwarder and its agents for payment of freight charges and/or C.O.D. amounts is limited to a maximum of two thousand U.S. dollars (US$2,000.00) per Shipment and/or stop. Payment of freight charges and/or C.O.D. amounts in excess of two thousand U.S. dollars (US$2,000.00) shall be remitted by cashier’s check, certified check, money order, or consignee’s check as authorized by Shipper in writing.</p>
<p>22. Forwarder shall have the right to, for any reason, (a) substitute alternate carriers or other means of transportation (including all ground transportation) and (b) select the routing or deviate from that shown on the face hereof. If Shipper requests motor carrier service or if Forwarder decides that Shipper’s Shipment should be transported by motor carriage rather than air, Forwarder shall arrange with authorized motor carrier(s) to perform such transportation, which shall be done as “contract carriage” within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. § 13102(4)(B) on the same terms as contained in this Agreement. Shipper expressly waives all rights and remedies it may have as to Forwarder and its subcontractor motor carriers under 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV, Part B (excluding §§ 13703, 13706, 14101 and 14103) to the full extent permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14101(b)(1), each as amended from time to time, and Shipper hereby agrees to the cargo liability standards and limitations set forth in these terms and conditions as to such motor carrier Shipment (including but not limited to Paragraphs 8, 12, 14, and 15).</p>
<p>23. The Shipper and the consignee shall be liable jointly and severally for all unpaid charges payable on account of this Shipment pursuant to this airbill contract and to pay or indemnify Forwarder for claims, fines, penalties, damages, costs (storage, handling, reconsignment, return of freight to Shipper, etc.) or other sums which may be incurred by Forwarder by reason of any violation of this contract or any other default of Shipper or consignee or their agents. All invoices not paid within 30 days of invoice date shall be subject to a charge of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, together with all collection costs incurred by Forwarder, including attorney fees.</p>
<p>24. Forwarder shall have a lien on any and all documents and Shipments of Shipper under Forwarder’s actual or constructive possession or control for monies owed to Forwarder with regard to the Shipment on which the lien is claimed, prior Shipment(s) or both. In the event Forwarder exercises its lien it shall notify Shipper of the exact amount of monies due and owing by Shipper. Forwarder shall also notify Shipper of all storage and continuing charges accruing on Shipments subject to carrier’s lien. Forwarder may refuse to surrender possession of the Shipment(s) until such charges are paid. Forwarder shall release its lien upon receipt of payment by Shipper of the total amount due. In the event Shipper does not satisfy Forwarder’s lien within fifteen (15) days of Forwarder’s exercise of the lien, Forwarder shall have the right, but not the obligation, to sell such Shipment(s) at public or private sale or auction without further notice to Shipper.</p>
<p>25. Shipper and consignee shall indemnify and hold Forwarder and its agents harmless for loss/damage/delay or any monetary losses which are a result of auxiliary services including but not limited to local cartage, crating, uncrating, packing, and unpacking which are requested by Shipper or consignee and arranged by Forwarder as a customer service unless such services are actually performed by Forwarder or its agents. Such indemnity obligation shall extend to the selection by Forwarder of the providers of the auxiliary services. Auxiliary services are those which are performed prior or subsequent to transportation and which may be billed directly by the provider of the services or by Forwarder. Providers of auxiliary services are contractors for Shipper or consignee and not agents of Forwarder. Local cartage is the movement of unpackaged/uncrated freight.</p>
<p>26. These terms and the services provided by Forwarder under this airbill shall be governed by and subject to the applicable federal law of the United States and by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the choice-of-law rules of New York or any other State. SHIPPER AND FORWARDER AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER UNDER FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, OR FOREIGN STATUTES, REGULATIONS, OR COMMON LAW, SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS SERVING ORCHARD PARK, NEW YORK. SHIPPER AND FORWARDER HEREBY CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. In the event Shipper files an action against Forwarder, Shipper hereby consents to any Forwarder-instituted transfer of such action to any other venue in which Forwarder is a party or subsequently becomes a party to an action concerning loss, damage or delay to the cargo that is the subject of Shipper’s action. Should Forwarder successfully defend itself or any legal actions brought by any party with an interest in this Shipment, Forwarder shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. NOTE: In lieu of legal actions, any disputed claim not greater than fifteen thousand U.S. dollars (US$15,000.00), and all claims arising in the event of bankruptcy of Shipper, shall be settled through binding arbitration submitted to the Transportation Arbitration Board or the American Arbitration Association under its cargo claim arbitration program. An alternative arbitrator is to be selected by Forwarder if the claim is unacceptable for arbitration by both of the foregoing arbitration organizations. The parties agree that no consolidated claims or class actions shall be arbitrated.</p>
<p>27. Any failure to enforce or apply a term or provision of the airbill, or of these Terms, shall not constitute a waiver of that term or provision by Forwarder, and shall not diminish or impair Forwarder’s right to enforce such term or provision in the future. No subcontractor, agent, or contracting carrier, or other provider has the authority to waive or vary any of these Terms. Only an authorized officer of Forwarder is authorized to change or modify these terms and any change or modification shall be in writing.</p>

                              <p><b>NATIONAL AIR CARGO, INC. INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS OF CARRIAGE</b></p>
<p>These <b>International Conditions of Carriage</b> apply only to shipments other than any (a “Domestic U.S. Shipment”) that originates in, is destined for, and does not include an ultimate destination or stop outside of the United States or any U.S. territory, possession, or commonwealth. For Domestic U.S. Shipments, please see <b>the National Air Cargo, Inc. U.S. Terms and Conditions</b>.</p>
<p><b>NOTICE CONCERNING CARRIER&#8217;S LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p>
<p>If the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the liability of the Carrier in respect of loss of, damage or delay to cargo. Carrier&#8217;s limitation of liability in accordance with those Conventions shall be as set forth in subparagraph 4 unless a higher value is declared.</p>
<p><b>CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT</b></p>
<p>1. In this contract and the Notices appearing hereon:</p>
<p>CARRIER includes the air carrier issuing this air waybill and all carriers that carry or undertake to carry the cargo or perform any other services related to such carriage.</p>
<p>SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHT (SDR) is a Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>WARSAW CONVENTION means whichever of the following instruments is applicable to the contract of carriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw, 12 October 1929;</li>
<li>that Convention as amended at The Hague on 28 September 1955;</li>
<li>that Convention as amended at The Hague 1955 and by Montreal Protocol No. 1, 2, or 4 (1975) as the case may be.</li>
</ul>
<p>MONTREAL CONVENTION means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, done at Montreal on 28 May 1999.</p>
<p>2./2.1 Carriage is subject to the rules relating to liability established by the Warsaw Convention or the Montreal Convention unless such carriage is not &#8220;international carriage&#8221; as defined by the applicable Conventions.</p>
<p>2.2 To the extent not in conflict with the foregoing, carriage and other related services performed by each Carrier are subject to:</p>
<p>2.2.1 applicable laws and government regulations;</p>
<p>2.2.2 provisions contained in the air waybill, Carrier&#8217;s conditions of carriage and related rules, regulations, and timetables (but not the times of departure and arrival stated therein) and applicable tariffs of such Carrier, which are made part hereof, and which may be inspected at any airports or other cargo sales offices from which it operates regular services. When carriage is to/from the USA, the shipper and the consignee are entitled, upon request, to receive a free copy of the Carrier&#8217;s conditions of carriage. The Carrier&#8217;s conditions of carriage include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>2.2.2.1 limits on the Carrier&#8217;s liability for loss, damage or delay of goods, including fragile or perishable goods;</p>
<p>2.2.2.2 claims restrictions, including time periods within which shippers or consignees must file a claim or bring an action against the Carrier for its acts or omissions, or those of its agents;</p>
<p>2.2.2.3 rights, if any, of the Carrier to change the terms of the contract;</p>
<p>2.2.2.4 rules about Carrier&#8217;s right to refuse to carry;</p>

<p>3. The agreed stopping places (which may be altered by Carrier in case of necessity) are those places, except the place of departure and place of destination, set forth on the face hereof or shown in Carrier&#8217;s timetables as scheduled stopping places for the route. Carriage to be performed hereunder by several successive Carriers is regarded as a single operation.</p>
<p>4. For carriage to which the Montreal Convention does not apply, Carrier&#8217;s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 19 SDRs per kilogram unless a greater per kilogram monetary limit is provided in any applicable Convention or in Carrier&#8217;s tariffs or general conditions of carriage.</p>
<p>5./5.1 Except when the Carrier has extended credit to the consignee without the written consent of the shipper, the shipper guarantees payment of all charges for the carriage due in accordance with Carrier&#8217;s tariff, conditions of carriage and related regulations, applicable laws (including national laws implementing the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention), government regulations, orders and requirements.</p>
<p>5.2 When no part of the consignment is delivered, a claim with respect to such consignment will be considered even though transportation charges thereon are unpaid.</p>
<p>6./6.1 For cargo accepted for carriage, the Warsaw Convention and the Montreal Convention permit shipper to increase the limitation of liability by declaring a higher value for carriage and paying a supplemental charge if required.</p>
<p>6.2 In carriage to which neither the Warsaw Convention nor the Montreal Convention applies Carrier shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in its general conditions of carriage and applicable tariffs, permit shipper to increase the limitation of liability by declaring a higher value for carriage and paying a supplemental charge if so required.</p>
<p>7./7.1 In cases of loss of, damage or delay to part of the cargo, the weight to be taken into account in determining Carrier&#8217;s limit of liability shall be only the weight of the package or packages lost, damaged or delayed.</p>
<p>7.2 Notwithstanding any other provisions, for &#8220;foreign air transportation&#8221; as defined by the U.S. Transportation Code:</p>
<p>7.2.1 In the case of loss of, damage or delay to a shipment, the weight to be used in determining Carrier&#8217;s limit of liability shall be the weight which is used to determine the charge for carriage of such shipment; and</p>
<p>7.2.2 in the case of loss of, damage or delay to a part of a shipment, the shipment weight in 7.2.1 shall be prorated to the packages covered by the same air waybill whose value is affected by the loss, damage or delay. The weight applicable in the case of loss or damage to one or more articles in a package shall be the weight of the entire package.</p>
<p>8. Any exclusion or limitation of liability applicable to Carrier shall apply to Carrier&#8217;s agents, employees, and representatives and to any person whose aircraft or equipment is used by Carrier for carriage and such person&#8217;s agents, employees and representatives.</p>
<p>9. Carrier undertakes to complete the carriage with reasonable dispatch. Where permitted by applicable laws, tariffs and government regulations, Carrier may use alternative carriers, aircraft or modes of transport without notice but with due regard to the interests of the shipper. Carrier is authorized by the shipper to select the routing and all intermediate stopping places that it deems appropriate or to change or deviate from the routing shown on the face hereof.</p>
<p>10. Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of the cargo without complaint shall be prima facie evidence that the cargo has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the contract of carriage.</p>
<p>10.1 In the case of loss of, damage or delay to cargo a written complaint must be made to Carrier by the person entitled to delivery. Such complaint must be made:</p>
<p>10.1.1 In the case of damage to the cargo, immediately after discovery of the damage and at the latest within 14 days from the date of receipt of the cargo;</p>

<p>10.2 Such complaint may be made to the Carrier whose air waybill was used, or to the first Carrier or to the last Carrier or to the Carrier, which performed the carriage during which the loss, damage or delay took place.</p>
<p>10.3 Unless a written complaint is made within the time limits specified in 10.1 no action may be brought against Carrier.</p>
<p>10.4 Any rights to damages against Carrier shall be extinguished unless an action is brought within two years from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the cargo ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped.</p>
<p>11. Shipper shall comply with all applicable laws and government regulations of any country to or from which the cargo may be carried, including those relating to the packing, carriage or delivery of the cargo, and shall furnish such information and attach such documents to the air waybill as may be necessary to comply with such laws and regulations. Carrier is not liable to shipper and shipper shall indemnify Carrier for loss or expense due to shipper&#8217;s failure to comply with this provision.</p>
<p>12. No agent, employee or representative of Carrier has authority to alter, modify or waive any provisions of this contract.</p>
<p><b><u>NATIONAL&#8217;S INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS OF CARRIAGE</u></b></p>

<p>13.4 &#8220;Shipper&#8221; and &#8220;shipper&#8221; mean the party that tendered the Shipment, requested the Shipment be transported by Carrier, has an interest in the Shipment, or acts as an agent for any of the above.</p>

<p>13.6 The term &#8220;conveyance&#8221; means any steamer, vessel, barge, aircraft, truck, trailer, or rail car, or any connecting conveyance while in the ordinary course of transit by land, sea, or air.</p>
<p>14. <b><u>Agreement to Terms</u></b>. By tendering a Shipment to National or arranging with National for a Shipment&#8217;s transportation or signing National&#8217;s Airbill, Shipper agrees to all of National&#8217;s International Conditions of Carriage. In case of a conflict between any of the terms set forth in 1-12 herein and 13-32 herein, the terms set forth in 13-32 shall control. In case of conflict between National&#8217;s International Conditions of Carriage and the tariff of National, the tariff shall control. In case of a conflict between a separate written agreement between National and Shipper and National&#8217;s International Conditions of Carriage or any tariff, the terms of the separate written agreement shall control. Tariffs are available at all National offices for inspection and upon request by Shipper. In the event any Shipment is tendered to Carrier on a straight bill of lading or any other shipping document, Shipper agrees that National&#8217;s International Conditions of Carriage, as well as the terms and conditions in the tariff of Carrier shall supersede any rules, regulations or contractual terms contained on the shipping document on which the Shipment was tendered.</p>
<p>15. <b><u>Completion of Airbill and Packaging</u></b>. Shipper certifies and represents to Carrier that the information inserted on the face of National&#8217;s Airbill is complete and accurate. Shipper warrants that each package in the Shipment is properly, accurately, and completely described on the shipping document, is properly classified, marked, labeled, and addressed, is packaged adequately to protect the enclosed goods to insure safe transportation with ordinary care and handling, and except as noted, is in good order and condition. For articles shipped in un-enclosed containers, Carrier shall not be liable for damage or loss unless mishandling and/or loss is evident and is so noted on the delivery receipt at the time of delivery. NOTE: Any Shipment in which delivery is made in exchange for a clear delivery receipt shall be prima facie evidence of having received ordinary care in handling.</p>
<p>16. <b><u>Limitations on Liability</u></b>.</p>
<p>16.1 Carrier shall not be liable for any loss, damage, misdelivery, delay, non-delivery not caused by its own negligence, or any loss, damage, delay, misdelivery, or non-delivery caused by the act, default or omission of Shipper, the consignee, or any other party that claims an interest in the shipment; the nature of the shipment or any defect, characteristic, or inherent vice thereof; act of God, perils of the air, public enemies, public authorities acting with actual or apparent authority of law, acts, or omissions of customs or quarantine officials, riots, strikes, civil commotions, hazards incident to a state of war, weather conditions, or delay of aircraft or other vehicles used in providing transportation services; acts or omissions of any Carrier or other entity or person to which a shipment is tendered by National for transportation beyond that provided by National, regardless of whether the Shipper requested or had knowledge of such third party delivery arrangement.</p>
<p>16.2 The following articles shall not be accepted for carriage: any Shipment prohibited by law; household goods and/or personal effects; original works of art, antiques, bonds, coins of any kind, currency, currency equivalents, furs, fur clothing, gems or stones (cut or uncut), industrial diamonds, gold or silver, coined concentrates, jewelry (other than costume jewelry), pearls, precious metals, securities (negotiable), time sensitive written material (for example, bids, contract proposals, etc.), when the declared value exceeds fifty U.S. cents (US$0.50) per pound; or one-of-a-kind articles or models, prototypes, valuable rugs (that is, Oriental rugs, Persian rugs) and prints or lithographs when the total declared value of the Shipment exceeds five hundred U.S. dollars (US$500.00) or when the declared value exceeds $0.50 per pound, per piece. Carrier shall not be liable for any loss, damage, delay, liabilities or penalties resulting from the transportation of any of the foregoing articles, however described or misdescribed in National&#8217;s Airbill, and no employee or agent of Carrier has any authority to accept for transportation such articles or to waive the limitations herein contained.</p>
<p>16.3 Under no circumstances shall Carrier be liable for punitive or exemplary damages, or special or consequential damages or other indirect loss, however arising whether or not Carrier has knowledge or should have had knowledge that such damages might be incurred, including, but not limited to loss of profits, income, interest, utility or loss of market.</p>
<p>16.4 While National shall endeavor to provide delivery in accordance with regular delivery schedules, National shall not, except as the Convention may otherwise require, under any circumstances, be liable for delay in pick up, transportation or delivery of any shipment regardless of the cause of the delay.</p>
<p>17. <b><u>Declared Value</u></b>. Shipper assumes all risk of any loss, damage, or delay in excess of the liability limitations set forth herein unless a higher value is declared on the front of this airbill and the additional applicable charges are paid to National. If Shipper sends more than one piece on an airbill, Shipper shall specify the declared value for each piece; otherwise, the declared value for each piece shall be determined by dividing the total declared value by the number of pieces on the airbill. The maximum declared value per Shipment is one hundred thousand U.S. dollars (US$100,000), and any effort to declare a value in excess of this maximum, except by obtaining written authorization from a corporate officer of National, shall be null and void. Regardless of the value declared, the number of Shipments transported by Carrier, or the number of distinct shippers affected by a disaster, accident, or other event, Carrier&#8217;s liability for loss, damage, or delay shall not be more than two million U.S. dollars (US$2,000,000) by any one conveyance, or in any one place, or at any one time, or in any one disaster, accident, or other occurrence. Regardless of the value declared, Carrier&#8217;s liability for loss, damage or delay shall not exceed the Shipment&#8217;s repair cost, depreciated value or replacement cost, whichever is less.</p>
<p>18. <b><u>Claims Procedures</u></b>.</p>
<p>18.1 Except as noted in 5.2, no claim shall be processed by Carrier until all transportation charges have been paid. The amount of a claim may not be deducted from the transportation charges.</p>
<p>18.2 In the event of a claim the Shipment, its container(s), and its packing material shall be made available to Carrier for inspection at the delivery location shown on the Airbill. Written notice as required herein shall be dispatched to National at the following address: National Air Cargo, Inc., Attention: Claims Department, 350 Windward Drive, Orchard Park, New York 14127.</p>
<p>19.</p>
<p>Overcharges and Duplicate Payments</p>
<p>. Claims for overcharges or duplicative payments shall be made in writing and are extinguished unless received by National within one (1) year after the date of acceptance of the shipment by National.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20. <b><u>Right of Inspection and Screening</u></b>. Shipper hereby consents to a search or inspection of the cargo, including screening of the cargo, by Carrier, the Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (&#8220;TSA&#8221;), or other authorized government authorities. Carrier is not obligated to open and inspect the contents of any Shipment. Carrier shall have the right to refuse any article, the transportation of which is prohibited by its tariffs or by applicable law, orders or regulations, or the transportation of which, in National&#8217;s judgment, would be unsafe. If such Shipment should be accepted or transported, Carrier reserves the right to remove it and, if necessary, to abandon it. Where circumstances permit, such Shipment shall be stored at Shipper&#8217;s expense pending receipt of disposition instructions from Shipper.</p>
<p>21. <b><u>Right to Reject, Re-Route, or Use Different Mode of Transportation</u></b>.</p>
<p>21.1 Carrier reserves the right to reject any Shipment for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to, safety or security concerns. It is agreed that no time is fixed for the completion of carriage hereunder and that Carrier may, without notice and for any reason, (a) substitute alternate carriers or other means of transportation (including ocean and/or ground transportation) and (b) select the routing or deviate from that shown on the face hereof. Carrier assumes no obligation to forward the goods by any specified carrier, transportation mode, or route or to make connection at any point according to any particular schedule, and Carrier is hereby authorized to select, or deviate from, the transportation mode(s), carrier(s), or route(s), notwithstanding that the same may be stated on the face hereof. Shipper, consignee, and owner, jointly and severally guarantee payment of all charges and advances arising in such instances.</p>
<p>21.2 If Shipper requests motor carrier service or if National decides that Shipper&#8217;s shipment should be transported by motor carriage rather than air for all or part of the transportation, National shall arrange with authorized motor carrier(s) to perform such transportation, which shall be done either as exempt carriage as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 13506(a)(8), or, if not exempt, as &#8220;contract carriage&#8221; within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. § 13102(4)(B) on the same cargo liability limitations and terms as contained in National&#8217;s International Conditions of Carriage. Shipper expressly waives all rights and remedies it may have as to National and its subcontractor motor carriers under 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IV, Part B (excluding §§ 13703, 13706, 14101, and 14103) to the full extent permitted by 49 U.S.C. § 14101(b)(1), each as amended from time to time.</p>
<p>22. <b><u>Hazardous Materials/Dangerous Goods</u></b>. Shipper shall limit all packages containing hazardous materials/dangerous goods to the materials and quantities authorized for air transportation under the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;USDOT&#8221;) hazardous materials transportation regulations (49 C.F.R. Parts 171, 172, and 173) and the current edition of the International Air Transport Association (&#8220;IATA&#8221;) Dangerous Goods Regulations (together &#8220;HM/DG Regulations&#8221;). Shipper shall ensure that each Shipment requiring a Shipper&#8217;s Declaration of Dangerous Goods under the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations is accompanied by properly executed Declaration documents in conformity with the requirements of such IATA Regulations. Shipper shall also ensure, and Shipper hereby certifies, that, before tendering any Shipment containing hazardous materials/dangerous goods to Carrier, the contents of this consignment are fully and accurately described on the shipping papers by proper shipping name; are not prohibited for transport by air by the HM/DG Regulations; and are properly classified, packaged, marked, and labeled, and in proper condition for carriage by air as required by the HM/DG Regulations. Shipper hereby declares that all of the applicable air transport requirements have been met. This Paragraph shall apply regardless of the routing or transportation mode by which the Shipment is transported. Carrier reserves the right to reject any Shipment containing any known or suspected dangerous goods.</p>
<p>23. <b><u>Storage</u></b>. If for any reason, it is impossible for Carrier to complete this contract or if the consignee fails to accept delivery of the Shipment or any part thereof, Carrier shall notify Shipper and then may store the goods at the storage rates provided in its tariffs or, at its option may store the goods in the public warehouse in which event the storage rates charges by such warehouse shall apply. Goods which remain unclaimed for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of notice to Shipper may be sold by Carrier at public or private sales and the proceeds of such sale may be applied against any outstanding freight charges, advances or charges of any kind which are due. Any balance remaining after payment of such charges shall be remitted to Shipper, the consignee, or owner. However, Shipper, consignee, and owner shall remain jointly and severally liable to Carrier for any deficiency should the proceeds of such sales be insufficient to offset all charges due Carrier with respect to the goods. Shipper and consignee agree jointly and severally to indemnify Carrier and to hold carrier harmless against all loss and expense, including attorney&#8217;s fees of whatever nature brought by any other owner or other person having an interest in the goods sold under this provision.</p>
<p>24. <b><u>Custom Duties and Other Fees</u></b>. Carrier is authorized (but shall be under no obligation) to advance any duties, taxes, or charges and to make any disbursements with respect to the goods, and Shipper, owner and consignee shall be jointly and severally liable for the reimbursement thereof. Carrier shall be under no obligation to incur any expense or to make any advance in connection with the forwarding or reforwarding of the goods except against repayment by Shipper. If it is necessary to make customs entry of the goods at any place, the goods shall be deemed to be consigned at such place to the person named on the face hereof as customs consignee or, if no such person be named, to such customs consignee as Carrier may designate.</p>
<p>25. <b><u>Lien Rights</u></b>. National shall have a lien on any and all documents and Shipments of Shipper under National&#8217;s actual or constructive possession or control for monies owed to National with regard to the Shipment on which the lien is claimed, prior Shipment(s) or both. In the event National exercises its lien it shall notify Shipper of the exact amount of monies due and owing by Shipper. National shall also notify Shipper of all storage and continuing charges accruing on Shipments subject to National&#8217;s lien. National may refuse to surrender possession of the Shipment(s) until such charges are paid. National shall release its lien upon receipt of payment by Shipper of the total amount due. In the event Shipper does not satisfy National&#8217;s lien within fifteen (15) days of National&#8217;s exercise of the lien, National shall have the right, but not the obligation, to sell such Shipment(s) at public or private sale or auction without further notice to Shipper.</p>
<p>26. <b><u>Payment Term</u></b>. All charges are due and payable upon receipt of the invoice. Any payment which is past due shall be subject to an additional charge of one and one-half percent (1-½%) per month of the outstanding balance due or the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, together with all collection costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by Carrier.</p>
<p>27. <b><u>Severability</u></b>. If any provision contained or referred to in National&#8217;s Airbill may be contrary to mandatory law, government regulations, orders, or requirements, such provision shall remain applicable to the extent that it is not overridden thereby. The invalidity of any provision shall not affect any other part hereof.</p>
<p>28. <b><u>Shipper&#8217;s Indemnities</u></b>. Shipper and consignee shall indemnify and hold Carrier and its agents harmless for loss/damage/delay or any monetary losses which are a result of auxiliary services including but not limited to local cartage, crating, uncrating, packing, and unpacking which are requested by Shipper or consignee and arranged by Carrier as a customer service unless such services are actually performed by Carrier or its agents. Such indemnity shall extend to the selection by Carrier of the providers of the auxiliary services. Auxiliary services are those which are performed prior or subsequent to transportation and which may be billed directly by the provider of the services or by Carrier. Providers of auxiliary services are contractors for Shipper or consignee and not agents of Carrier. Local cartage is the movement of unpackaged/uncrated freight. NOTE: Under no circumstances shall the liability of Carrier for any monetary loss which is a result of any auxiliary services performed by Carrier or its agents be greater than the liability set forth in this contract, even if such loss was foreseeable.</p>
<p>29. <b><u>Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</u></b>. The National&#8217;s International Conditions of Carriage and the services provided by Carrier under National&#8217;s Airbill shall be governed by and subject to the applicable federal law of the United States and by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the choice-of-law rules of New York or any other State. SHIPPER AND CARRIER AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER UNDER FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, OR FOREIGN STATUTES, REGULATIONS, OR COMMON LAW, SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS SERVING ORCHARD PARK, NEW YORK. SHIPPER AND CARRIER HEREBY CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. In the event Shipper files an action against Carrier, Shipper hereby consents to any Carrier-instituted transfer of such action to any other venue in which Carrier is a party or subsequently becomes a party to an action concerning loss, damage or delay to the cargo that is the subject of Shipper&#8217;s action. Should Carrier successfully defend itself or any legal actions brought by any party with an interest in this Shipment, Carrier shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs. NOTE: In lieu of legal actions, any disputed claim not greater than fifteen thousand U.S. dollars (US$15,000.00), and all claims arising in the event of bankruptcy of Shipper, shall be settled through binding arbitration submitted to the Transportation Arbitration Board or the American Arbitration Association under its cargo claim arbitration program. An alternative arbitrator is to be selected by Carrier if the claim is unacceptable for arbitration by both of the foregoing arbitration organizations. The parties agree that no consolidated claims or class actions shall be arbitrated.</p>
<p>30. <b><u>Domestic Shipments</u></b>. In the event that National&#8217;s Airbill is used for domestic freight movement (any shipment that originates in, is destined for, and does not include an ultimate destination or stop outside of the United States or any U.S. territory, possession, or commonwealth), Carrier&#8217;s limitation of liability for lost, damaged or delayed freight shall be the lesser of: (A) the amount of the damages actually sustained and proven or (B) the greater of $0.50 per pound multiplied by the weight of the shipment, or $50.00 per shipment plus freight charges applicable to that part of the Shipment lost, damaged or delayed unless a different declared value is specified by Shipper in the manner set forth in Section 17 hereof.</p>
<p>31. <b><u>Shipments to Which Convention Does Not Apply, Other Than Domestic Shipments</u></b>. For carriage that is not a domestic shipment as addressed in Paragraph 30 and to which neither the Warsaw Convention nor the Montreal Convention applies, Carrier&#8217;s limitation of liability for lost, damaged, or delayed freight shall be 19 SDR per kilogram, plus freight charges applicable to that part of the Shipment lost, damaged or delayed unless a different declared value is specified by Shipper in the manner set forth in Section 17 hereof.</p>
<p>32. <b><u>Cargo Security Requirements</u></b>. Shipper acknowledges that National, like all indirect air carriers, is required by TSA to maintain an air cargo security program. If Shipper is acting as an agent, authorized representative, broker, carrier, consolidator, or other freight intermediary for any other person or entity, Shipper shall disclose that fact to National and shall assist National in complying with the TSA requirements by enabling National to obtain any necessary documents from, or otherwise qualify, such other person or entity. If Shipper, as the person who originates and tenders cargo for air transportation or as such person&#8217;s representative, is an individual (natural person), such person shall advise National of that fact, and National shall, if required by law, provide Shipper or such person with a Privacy Act Notice.</p>
<p>33. <b><u>Code of Ethics and Business Conduct</u></b>. National Air Cargo, Inc. is committed to conducting operations with the highest standards of business conduct and ethics. It is important that our customers and suppliers understand that we believe a strong and proactive culture of ethics is critical to all of our success and growth.
